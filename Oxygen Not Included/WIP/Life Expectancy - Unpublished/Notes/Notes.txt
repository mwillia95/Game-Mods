The starting age and length of the effects should be within a predefined range of values for each 
state of the life cycle.

If the starting age of a cycle is later in the range, the starting age for the next cycle should also
be posotiioned further away.

The distance between states should have a minimum predefined distance in cycles. After the minimum, a MinMax
range to when the next state begins still applies. Further, when the state begins, the state has a random range
for how long it lasts.

Example:

NewlyPrinted (2-4 cycles)
Standard for 0-0 cycles
NewlyAdjust (8-12 cycles)
Standard for 75-100 cycles
MidLife Crisis (8-14 cycles)
Standard for 35-50 cycles
Ageing (30-50 cycles)
Elder (20-40 cycles)
Dying of Old Age (3-5 cycles)


Every state has a range in how long before it begins and how long it lasts. When a state ends, it returns to
a normal state (no modifiers). If a state begins in 0-0 cycles, it immediately begins when the previous
state ended.
